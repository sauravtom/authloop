# Authloop
OpenSource Biometric SDK for securing fintech applications.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Serves as the primary programming language due to its extensive support for data processing, machine learning, and integration capabilities.
- **OpenCV**: Utilized for facial recognition features, providing a powerful suite of tools for image processing and computer vision.
- **SciPy and NumPy**: For advanced mathematical computations, signal processing, and linear algebra operations which are essential in processing biometric data.

### Machine Learning and AI

- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For developing and training machine learning models for both face and voice recognition. TensorFlow offers a flexible platform for deep learning, while Keras provides a high-level API to speed up development.
- **Librosa**: A Python library for audio analysis, perfect for extracting features from voice data, which is crucial for audio biometric verification.

### Database and Storage

- **PostgreSQL**: A robust and secure relational database to store user data, biometric templates, and authentication logs.
- **Amazon S3**: For secure and scalable cloud storage of biometric data, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.

### Backend and API Development

- **Flask/Django**: Flask for creating lightweight microservices for different biometric processes, or Django for a more structured approach with its built-in features for rapid development and deployment.
- **RESTful API**: Designing APIs for client-server communication, enabling seamless integration with mobile and web applications.

### Security and Compliance

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure transmission of information between parties as a JSON object, crucial for authentication and information exchange.
- **OAuth 2.0**: For secure authorization workflows, especially when integrating third-party services.
- **SSL/TLS**: To encrypt data in transit, protecting sensitive biometric data and user information.

### Deployment and Operations

- **Docker**: For containerizing the application, ensuring consistency across different development and production environments.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating container deployment, scaling, and management, particularly useful for handling high-traffic applications.
- **AWS/GCP**: As cloud service providers for hosting, computing, and database services, offering scalability, reliability, and global reach.

### Development and Monitoring Tools

- **Git**: For version control, facilitating collaborative development and code management.
- **Sentry/New Relic**: For real-time error tracking and application performance monitoring, ensuring high availability and reliability.


## Authloop Architecture Design

### 1. **User Interface (UI) Layer**

- **Mobile and Web Applications**: Users interact with Authloop through mobile apps or web applications. This layer is responsible for capturing biometric data (face images and voice samples) and displaying authentication results.

### 2. **Application Programming Interface (API) Layer**

- **Authentication API**: Serves as the intermediary for processing authentication requests, receiving biometric data from the UI, and sending commands to the backend services.
- **Data Management API**: Handles user data, including registration details and biometric templates, ensuring secure storage and retrieval.

### 3. **Application Logic Layer**

- **Biometric Processing Service**:
    - **Face Recognition Service**: Utilizes OpenCV and TensorFlow for detecting, analyzing, and comparing facial features against stored templates.
    - **Voice Recognition Service**: Employs Librosa and TensorFlow to analyze voice samples, extracting unique features for verification against stored voice prints.
- **User Management Service**: Manages user accounts, permissions, and session management.

### 4. **Data Storage Layer**

- **Biometric Database**: Stores encrypted biometric templates (face and voice prints) in PostgreSQL, ensuring high security and fast access.
- **User Database**: Maintains user profiles, authentication logs, and session data, facilitating efficient user management and audit trails.

### 5. **Infrastructure Layer**

- **Cloud Infrastructure (AWS/GCP)**: Hosts the application, providing scalable compute resources, storage, and networking capabilities.
- **Containerization (Docker)**: Packages the application and its dependencies into containers for consistent deployment across all environments.
- **Orchestration (Kubernetes)**: Manages the containers, ensuring they are running, scaled, and updated as needed.

### 6. **Security and Compliance**

- **Encryption**: Applies SSL/TLS for data in transit and AES for data at rest, protecting sensitive information.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implements JWT and OAuth 2.0 for secure access control and identity verification.
- **Compliance Tools**: Automated tools to monitor and enforce GDPR, CCPA, and other regulatory standards.

### 7. **Monitoring and Operations**

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Utilizes tools like Sentry and New Relic for real-time monitoring, logging, and alerting to ensure system health and performance.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrates Git, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery, facilitating rapid development and deployment cycles.
